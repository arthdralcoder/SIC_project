# Heart rate sensor using ESP - 32 for stress detection 

Stress produces serious physical and mental injury that is challenging to identify. To identify irregularities that could result in chronic illnesses, it is crucial to constantly evaluate stress levels. IoT based wireless networks provide the ability to use sensors to measure stress levels and broadcast the data for quick action. The effects of stress can be profound and seriously detrimental to an individual's physical and mental health. Even though a person seems to be in good physical health, stress can still exist in the body and lead to a number of chronic diseases. Stress can also affect mental stability, which can cause additional problems. As a result, regular stress monitoring is crucial for diagnosing.

# PROPOSED SYSTEMS

There are many existing technologies in the market which are working on stress detection. With respect to that we have developed a system that is less costly and very easy to use. Itâ€™s a real-time application that lets people detect their stress levels and possible issues associated with it and decide on further actions to be taken.
